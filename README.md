# Totally-Cubular
This is my first attempt at making a game combining pygame with OpenGL. It is still in progress.

This game is another obstical avoidance game but in the first person, with 3D obstacles falling from above. 

Controls: 
Arrow keys control movement in cardinal directions.

Special Thanks:
Sentdex, whose stellar YouTube tutorials helped make this possible.
The amazing Python community for developing such awesome tools!
